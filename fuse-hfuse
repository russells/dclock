Notes:

1. The SPIEN Fuse is not accessible in serial programming mode.

2. See Table 29-8 on page 357 for details.

3. See “WDTCSR – Watchdog Timer Control Register” on page 65 for details.

4. Never ship a product with the OCDEN Fuse programmed regardless of the
   setting of Lock bits and JTAGEN Fuse. A programmed OCDEN Fuse enables
   some parts of the clock system to be running in all sleep modes. This
   may increase the power consumption.
