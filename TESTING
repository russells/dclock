* Initial test

** Start the clock.
*** Confirm it is in normal time mode.
** Note the time.
** Let it tick for a few seconds.
** Press reset.
*** confirm the time continues from where it was.

* Time mode change test.

** Press the secret button sequence.
*** Confirm the clock changes to decimal time.
*** Confirm that the decimal time matches the previous normal time.

* Time mode change consistency test

For this test, perhaps change the button sequence to something simpler.

** Set the alarm to a known time.
** Change back and forth between normal and decimal modes.
*** Confirm that the time changes consistently between modes.
*** Confirm that the alarm time is consistent between modes.
** Change between modes, and set the alarm at each change.
Set the alarm by changing to off, then on, but not changing the alarm time.
*** Confirm that the alarm time ratchets backwards.
This confirms that the seconds part of the alarm time is forced to zero.

* Normal alarm time test

** Start in normal mode.
** Set the alarm for a minute in the future.
*** alarm triggers.
*** stops when SELECT is pressed.
*** goes into snooze when select is quickly released.
** Wait until alarm triggers again.
*** stops when up or down pressed.
*** goes into snooze when up or down released, no matter how long the press.
** Wait until alarm triggers again.
*** stops when select pressed and held.
*** turns off when select held for a long press then released.

* Decimal alarm time test

** Start in decimal mode.
** All the same tests as for the normal alarm time test.

* Alarm mode change consistency test

** Change back and forth between normal and decimal modes.
*** Confirm that the alarm time is constant at each change.

Note that the time should stable at 36 minute normal intervals, or 25
minute decimal intervals.

* Terminology
** Alarm on
The alarm is enabled, so that when the current time matches the alarm time,
the alarm will start running.
** Alarm off
The alarm is not enabled.
** Alarm running
The current time has matched the alarm time and the alarm is making sound
and light.
** Alarm stopped
The alarm is not making sound and light, and may be on or off.
