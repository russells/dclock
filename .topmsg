Subject: Use a Teensy, instead of an Arduino.

The Teensy++ 2.0 is smaller, has more IO, more of all types of memory,
and a 0.1 inch footprint.  It uses an 8 bit AVR, similar to the
Arduino.

This will only duplicate the current feature set.  Adding features
comes later.

TODO:

- Allocate IO from the AT90USB1286 to the dclock.

- Breadboard the new prototype.
